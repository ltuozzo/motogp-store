This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies used

- Next.js: I decided to use this framework because it works great with SEO, and since this is an eCommerce page, google placement is very important. Next.js works with react, but renders the HTML on the server so that google crawlers can get information from the page once it's loaded.
- TypeScript: When working with API's I like working with TS, because it helps me organize the data that I'm expecting to work with when creating a new component. Big red alerts come up when types don't match and it helps to avoid issues.

## Notably missing

- Scss: I don't know why I didn't install it when I created the project, and by the time I realized I wasn't using it, I was already half-way through. The end result would have probably been the same, but the code would probably have been tidier.

## Final notes

I left a couple of comments on the code regarding some decisions I made. The whole page is a little rough around the edges. I didn't have a lot of time to polish, since I only started working on this after coming back from spending the holidays with my family. Also, only having a jpg as a design, meant that I had to take some liberties regarding the stiling, some of which, I consider to be an improvement, others, not so much.

All in all, it took me around 24hs hours to develop, spread across four days.

I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have regarding the website.

Warm regards,

Lucas Tuozzo
